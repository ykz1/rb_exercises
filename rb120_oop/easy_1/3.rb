# Further exploration: we need a getter method to be able to call `book.title` and `book.author`, so we're down to `attr_reader` and `attr_accessor`. The latter would work but would extend the user's capabilities beyond just read to write as well, which we likely want to restrict.

# Adding functions to retrieve `@title` and `@author`  would work the same as `attr_reader :title, :author`. The advantage would be if we wanted to alter what is returned when these functions are calledâ€”it would be simpler to do so with the methods defined normally.
